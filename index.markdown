I am a Software Engineer, currently working as a Java Software Engineer, with over 9 years of experience in the IT industry.

Most of my professional experience is with back-end technologies, but I can also work with front-end code or perform DevOps tasks.

I am also a software and information security enthusiast. I pursue this passion through being a regular player in CTF competitions.
